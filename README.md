# whatever.vimrc

I guess I should use a uniform git environment

## Installation

1. Clone this baby  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/reanimus/whatever.vimrc ~/.vim` 
2. Clone Vundle  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
3. Open vim and install bundles  
   `:BundleInstall` 
4. (Depends on version) Some versions of vim don't know to use `~/.vim/vimrc`, in which case you should link it.  
   `$ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
