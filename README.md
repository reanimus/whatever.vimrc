# whatever.vimrc

I guess I should use a uniform git environment

## Installation

1. Clone this baby  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/reanimus/whatever.vimrc ~/.vim` 
2. (Depends on version) Some versions of vim don't know to use `~/.vim/vimrc`, in which case you should link it.  
   `$ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
3. Open vim (wow autoinstall, such beautiful)
